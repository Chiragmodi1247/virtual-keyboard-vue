## Problem Statement
1. The virtual keyboard needs to facilitate numbers, special characters, and alphabets along with space, delete, enter, shift and caps lock.
2. If the user clicks the normal keys like alphabets or letters, the keys should change its position randomly.
3. Ensure keys like delete, shift, caps lock works as expected.

On pressing any key on keyboard it shuffles the order of the keys. You can change shuffle types also.
